Loading required package: optmatch
Loading required package: testthat
You're loading optmatch, by Ben Hansen, a package for flexible
 and optimal matching.  Important license information:
 The optmatch package makes essential use of D. P. Bertsekas
 and P. Tseng's RELAX-IV algorithm and code, as well as
 Bertsekas' AUCTION algorithm and code.
 Bertsekas and Tseng freely permit their software to be used for
 research purposes, but non-research uses, including the use of it
 to 'satisfy in any part commercial delivery requirements to
 government or industry,' require a special agreement with them.
 By extension, this requirement applies to any use of the 
 fullmatch() function. (If you are using another package that has
 loaded optmatch, then you will probably be using fullmatch indirectly.)
 For more information, enter relaxinfo() at the command line
